# TCS_Website
 This is the new business website for The Code Source.

This is a very messy project since I really just kept fucking around with CSS until it looked okay. I stole
some of it from a 

Ok to run and check on the webpage live we need to do a few things:
1.) in the terminal type in npm install
    this will install all of the dev dependencies listed in the node_module folder
2.) then type in npm index
    this will automatically start the server on your local machine
    type localhost3000 into your url to boot up the website
    ExpressJS automatically sets url routes to any of the html files listed in the public folder
3.) ctrl + C in the terminal will shut off the server whenever you need to reboot it

 TODO:
 
 Make the website look pretty. There are a few CSS issues. Please check and fix any you see or honestly rewrite
 if you have to. Off the top of my head there are a few that have to do with media queries. The navigation icons 
 go into a pyramid which looks weird and the scroll bar obstructs some of the .post class on the smallest minimization.
 If you think you can make the logo look cool please go ahead and do so. I even included some of the Illustrator files (probably
 super messy and annoying, I suck at art). 
 Then I need you to check browser compatability. Run the program against different browsers and see if things break.

 At that point if it looks clear feel free to do whatever you want with it. There is a really useful Javascript framework
 called ReactJS which lets you break Html and CSS and turn it into these little components that you can repeat. I manually
 copied and pasted each Html file and made small edits to them but it would be way easier to use Javascript instead, it would
 probably open job opportunities for you too.

 The whole website so far is based on Node JS. This is a Javascript framework that does backend shenanigans, and the Express
 library helps simplify it. You can port the code over to any backend you want, even ASP.NET but that shit is brolic. Just be aware
 you might have to learn a little NodeJS/ExpressJS.

 Happy coding! :)
