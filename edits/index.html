		<h2>What Else Do We Do?</h2>
		<p>
			We also specialize in upgrading older systems! If you have an out-of-date software application that has served you well but no longer meets your needs, we can port its functionality to a newer technology platform, reproducing the features you like, and adding the new functionality you really need. We provide training and support for all our systems. Our staff is personable, articulate, knowledgeable, and ready to assist you when you need help.
		</p>
		<p>
			Are you a small business owner who needs specialized software but is concerned it will be too expensive? We scale our software development pricing based on the size of your company and the number of system users. Small businesses will therefore be charged a lower rate, making our software solutions affordable to even the smallest companies.
